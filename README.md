# Advanced Programming Techniques M135

This repository contains solutions to the three main projects for the "Advanced Programming Techniques" master’s course. Each project explores a programming concept in Java, ranging from reflection and asynchronous programming to aspect-oriented programming.

## Project 1: Reflection in Java

The first project focuses on Java’s reflection capabilities, allowing code to examine or modify its own structure at runtime. This project explores how reflection can be used for dynamic class analysis, method invocation, and more.

- Folder: Project_1
- Project_1/Extra Classes: Additional classes used to test the reflection code.

## Project 2: Asynchronous Programming with Promises

The second project is an introduction to asynchronous programming in Java. Inspired by JavaScript’s Promise model, this project involved implementing a similar structure using Java’s asynchronous capabilities, without relying on higher-level frameworks.

- Folder: Project_2
- Core Concepts: Implementing asynchronous operations, managing callbacks, and handling potential exceptions asynchronously.
- Testing: Code functionality was tested using Groovy, which allowed for efficient and expressive test cases.

## Project 3: Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Basics

The final project covers the basics of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). The goal was to implement fundamental AOP functionalities such as before, after, and around advice on a target method, enabling the separation of cross-cutting concerns.

- Folder: Project_3
- Core Concepts: Creating AOP-style methods to inject behavior before, after, or around specific operations.
